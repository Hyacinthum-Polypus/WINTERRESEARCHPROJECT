There is a growing global movement among economic, public policy
and academic communities questioning the appropriateness of gross
domestic product (GDP), and specifically its growth, as an indicator of
progress. Despite the broad range of indices and dashboards that have
been developed to challenge it, GDP remains entrenched as the essential
indicator of national prosperity, despite its purpose being to measure
the size and performance of the economy. The strength of GDP lies in
its established centrality in policymaking as well as its rhetorical and
conceptual simplicity; it is in essence the value of monetized tangible
goods and services produced in a given period. Unlike well-being
indicator dashboards, GDP provides a single measure against which
governments, the media and the general community can track and
compare national economic performance. And, while many composite
indices offer monotonously stable findings, the weekly, quarterly and
annual fluctuations of GDP prompt policymakers to act (that is, to
assess reforms, identify constraints and shift policy levers to enhance its
growth). By contrast, the Mental Wealth metric offers a new approach.
Rather than joining the chorus of moving beyond GDP, the Mental
Wealth Initiative first recognises the system of national accounts that
underpins GDP as a significant human achievement. The initiative then
seeks to refine, augment and improve GDP as a measure of social welfare
by broadening the boundary of production to include the value of goods
and services provided by populations that are not currently monetized
but make genuine contributions to social prosperity and quality of life.
Hence, the Mental Wealth metric provides a holistic measure of national
prosperity, capturing the value of both economic and social production,
and recognizing the fundamental importance of brain capital (mental
capital, mental health and brain health) and collective cognitive and
emotional health and well-being. This paper provides a simple, practical
strategy for augmenting GDP by monetizing social production, thereby
establishing a more accurate indicator of the wealth of nations.

Humans are ‘ultra-social’ beings [1] . The nature and quality of our social ties
are central to our health and well-being, which underpin individual-level
capability and resilience [2][,][3] . At a societal level, how social systems are
structured and the strength and operation of social networks are fundamental to community cohesion and social stability [2] . Social networks can
profoundly shape people’s access to both resources and opportunities.
Participation in socially productive activities has been shown to improve
quality of life [4] ; physical, cognitive, and mental health [5][–][9] ; and labour
market outcomes through skills training and access to the labour force [10] .
Social mobilization around ecosystem maintenance and restoration
(for example, rewilding) has the potential to contribute significantly
to economic prosperity given that at least half of the world’s GDP is
dependent on nature [11][,][12], and given that the global ecological footprint
has exceeded global biocapacity [13] . Despite these individual, societal,
environmental and economic benefits, unpaid socially productive activities are not currently valued within the existing economic framework,
leaving their contributions to national prosperity unrecognized. In addition, GDP contains a number of ‘regrettables’—activities that increase
economic activity but do not contribute to quality of life such as war,
higher transport costs due to traffic congestion, pollution abatement
and reconstruction following natural disasters [14] .

                                                  The exclusion of (unpaid) informal and socially productive activi
ties from estimates of national prosperity has significant implications.
First, social and economic development is fundamentally shaped by
what is measured [15][,][16] . Measurement makes the invisible visible, giving
credence to the value of social production. Measurement helps to
assess progress, stimulate public debate, aid advocacy efforts, promote community mobilization, and inform policy and investment
priorities. Historically, the system of national accounts (giving rise to
GDP as the key measure of economic performance) were created during successive profound crises (the Great Depression and the Second
World War) not only to measure the size, growth and composition of
national economies, but also to inform war-time production and postwar reconstruction efforts [17][,][18] . The mechanisms of national accounting
are said to have evolved to serve underlying political purposes, which
leads to the question: ‘What would they measure if other purposes were
dominant?’ [18] . As we look to current widespread efforts to shift societal trajectories (such as the movements to achieve greater equality,
arrest climate change and catalyse post-pandemic reconstruction
for enhanced well-being and community and system resilience [19] ), our
efforts are likely to be impeded by the continued exclusion of socially
productive activities from the dominant economic metric: GDP.
Second, the exclusion of extra-market activities sends a signal that
society does not value the contributions made by those not in the formal
labour market. When employment is privileged as a legitimate social role
and indicator of societal integration, structural and social marginalization of the unemployed, older adults and the disabled lead to stigma,
inequality, lower social participation, intergenerational dependence
and care, and the erosion of mental health and well-being [20][–][22] . Placing
greater emphasis on the value of non-market activities undertaken in
and for communities may guard against these negative effects [23] .
Third, neglecting measurement of and investment in social production fails to recognise the extent to which it enhances economic
productivity (access to additional networks, resources, opportunities,
informal skills training and mentorship, and intergenerational knowledge transmission) and reduces demands on governments (through
the networks and norms of reciprocity it fosters) [24] .
We propose a new ‘Mental Wealth’ metric that seeks to quantify
the value of economic and social production to ensure a more complete picture of national (and regional) prosperity [25] . Mental Wealth is
defined as “a measure of national prosperity that captures the value
generated by the deployment of collective mental assets and supporting social infrastructure and focuses on the contributions made by all
human beings to material and especially non-material standards of
living” [25] . The metric makes an explicit attempt to shift the boundary of



































Equity along the interconnected drivers of Mental Wealth


**Fig. 1 | Defining Mental Wealth.** Mental Wealth is a holistic measure of national
prosperity that monetizes the value generated by a nation’s economic and social
productivity. Mental Wealth is underpinned by a nation’s collective mental
assets (brain capital) and influenced by a range of health, social, economic, and

environmental factors.


production of the traditional economy to include the value created by
non-market activity that contributes to strengthening the social and
cultural fabric of communities and social support in work settings.
Further, the Mental Wealth metric recognises ‘brain capital’ (a nation’s
collective mental assets: mental capital, mental health and well-being,
and brain health) as the foundation of economic and social productivity
(Fig. 1). Specifically, Mental Wealth is the monetary value of the market
and non-market goods and services produced by the population over
a given period, and is calculated as follows:


Mental Wealth = _μ_ GDP r + _C_ s + _I_ s


where GDP r is real GDP (for a given period) calculated using the
expenditure approach, _μ_ is the devaluation coefficient (the downward
adjustment to GDP r to account for the proportion of expenditure not
underpinned by mental capital; for example, the value of mineral
exports net of human input). _C_ s is the consumption of non-monetized,
socially provided services; _I_ s represents social capital infrastructure
investment, namely, the sum of government (and non-government)
investment in social capital infrastructure (in a given period), not already
captured in GDP [25] . Detailed discussion of the origins of Mental Wealth,
its formulation, comparisons with alternative indicators of national
prosperity, the importance of systems thinking and an outline of the
research programme in systems modelling of Mental Wealth is provided
elsewhere [25] . This paper seeks to outline more specifically the key constructs of _C_ s (social consumption) and _I_ s (social capital infrastructure
investment) and define a non-market valuation method to be applied.


**Social consumption**
Social consumption involves the use of socially provided services
outside the market. For tractability, the value of social production
will be used as a proxy for social consumption and its estimation will
depend on the measurement of time spent undertaking activities
that provide a social contribution. Social contribution will be viewed

### **Box 1**

## **Activity categories that contribute to estimating the social** **contribution of individuals to the Mental Wealth of nations**



**Category 1: Volunteering and unpaid charity work**
This category includes unpaid time spent participating
in emergency services (for example, lifesaving and
firefighting); volunteering at community festivals and
cultural events; fundraising undertaken in aid of a charity;
community gardening; participation in healthcare delivery
and free clinics; working in a soup kitchen; distributing
food, medical or material goods; providing legal advice;
providing counselling support; and making clothes for
disadvantaged populations.


**Category 2: Unpaid education and care of children**
This category includes unpaid time spent providing education,
active supervision and domestic care for a child or children aged
under 18 years including own children and children of friends,
neighbours and extended family. This also includes time spent
undertaking unpaid teaching at a school; providing tutoring or
homework assistance; passing on cultural knowledge, customs
and traditions (a matter of special importance to Indigenous
communities); and unpaid babysitting.


**Category 3: Unpaid care of older people and people with illnesses**

**or disabilities**

This category includes time spent undertaking unpaid
domestic support for older people and people with illnesses
or disabilities. Examples include assisting with self-care
activities, buying groceries for a neighbour, driving them to
appointments, assisting participation in cultural activities and
cleaning their home.


through the framework of a sociological model of social productivity based on the notion of exchange reciprocity. This involves the
provision of a social service valued by the recipient(s) for which
no contract or financial remuneration is exchanged (other than
potential reimbursement of expenses) [26] . Expressions of reciprocity
to fulfil unmet individual and community needs create new bonds
of solidarity between disparate groups of people, businesses and
public institutions through the acts of “giving, receiving and giving in return” [27][,][28] . While social productivity contributes value to the
measure of national prosperity (Mental Wealth), it also acts in part
to redistribute resources between the economic and social arenas,
acting as a temporary stabilizer to disruptive events. For example,
the services arising from mobilization of volunteers and charitable
community organizations in response to natural disasters can help
communities rebuild more quickly. Similarly, during the COVID-19
pandemic, social mobilization around public health orders sought
to arrest transmission and reduce the overall economic impact [29][,][30] .
Social production has the potential to reduce the need for government
services and can extend beyond government reach (for example, to
remote or marginalized communities). It does not, however, replace
the need for government provision of social services. Indeed, evidence
suggests that a country’s social spending (as a proportion of GDP)
and civic culture (for example, higher degrees of civil liberties) are
positively correlated with volunteerism, helping and caring [31] . An
important dimension of prosperity is caring economics comprising
affiliative and compassionate personal relationships, a sense of social



**Category 4: Crowd service**
This category includes time spent providing a ‘crowd service’ where
no direct or indirect (for example, advertising) income is received.
Consumers provide information, instructions, tools, advice and so on
to each other as an unpaid service (for example, Wikipedia, YouTube
videos, open-source software and blogs).


**Category 5: Unpaid contributions to the creative arts**
This category includes unpaid time spent performing and creating
works of art, music, dance, storytelling and drama.


**Excluded activities**

Excluded activities include individual hobbies; leisure time;
vacations; vlogging, reviewing and marketing of products; criminal
activities; volunteering during paid time off by an employer; and
non-childcare-related domestic activities in own home. Although
potentially controversial, under the current conceptual framework
of Mental Wealth, domestic duties in one’s own home are not
considered to contribute to social production, social connectedness,
and strengthening the social fabric of communities and nations.
Counting unpaid domestic activities within one’s own home would
detract from an emphasis on encouraging social and economic
participation outside the home, it would also introduce a source of
potential stability in the metric that would fail to detect changes in
social prosperity. For example, large proportions of the population
shifting from community-building volunteering activities to domestic
activities inside their own homes would significantly affect social
prosperity but would not be detected as a change in the Mental
Wealth metric (that is, if unpaid domestic work was included in _C_ s ).


belonging, cooperative contributions to the workplace and society,
and creating trustworthiness and trust [32] .
Because the production and consumption of social contributions
are not mediated by monetary valuation in markets, and given they
are likely to be differentially valued by receivers, monetary value will
be calculated based on the value of time spent delivering the social
contribution (input valuation). Activities that are socially valued by
any given community, region or nation are likely to differ by cultural,
historical, social, economic and political context. However, the key
activity categories outlined in Box 1 aim to capture social contributions that have universal relevance for estimation of Mental Wealth.

The activity categories outlined should not be considered exhaustive as they are likely to evolve and expand over time to account for
cultural and technological shifts. They merely offer a starting point
from which to elaborate, as per the historic evolution of the systems
of national accounts. The listing draws on long-established literature
concerning studies of time use [33], feminist economics [34], the nature of
volunteering [35] and principles that underpin the strengths of Indigenous
cultures [36][–][39] . Finally, it is intentional that the activity categories are
not weighted—time spent undertaking any of the outlined socially
productive activities (which will differ by age, sex, cultural background
and socioeconomic status) is considered to be of equal importance.


**Social capital infrastructure investment**
In devising a more appropriate metric for national prosperity, the other
element of gross national expenditure that needs to be augmented

**Perspective** https://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-023-00044-w



concerns investment. Traditionally, the composition of gross fixed
capital formation has concerned dwelling and non-dwelling construction along with investment in machinery and equipment. As national
accounts have evolved, new categories of investment have been recognised. The most recent additions have been cultivated biological
resources and intellectual property products. Within the Mental Wealth
framework, social capital infrastructure investment now seeks to
include the sum of government, community and private sector investments in the opportunity structures that enable social production
and social connectedness; namely, investments in facilities, spaces,
services and networks that are not already captured in GDP. Physical
and institutional social infrastructure are key to the propagation and
continuity of social connections, stability, the preservation of cultural
identity and maintenance of socio-cultural diversity of Indigenous and
local communities, and the vibrancy of civic life [40] . Investments directed
towards enhancing social and cultural centres can contribute to enriching connections within and across communities, thereby growing the
potential for individuals to be engaged in socially productive activities.
Provision of this infrastructure can be seen as an important factor
for creating opportunities for social and cultural participation and
developing the functional capabilities of a community as well as workplaces. The literature on the impact and value of such an investment has
not been sufficiently substantiated yet, given the complexity in determining the sources of social capital investment, its relation to social
capital formation, and the consequent socially productive activities [41] .
Additionally, data sources concerning social infrastructure spending
currently exist disparately at the workplace, community and regional
levels, adding to the complexity of obtaining a clear indication of the
scale and direction of investments. To capture the value that social capital infrastructure investments contribute to national prosperity, a more
precise measurement of this expenditure is needed. This would involve
consolidating information on social infrastructure and amenities use
and their resourcing. Although there is difficulty in capturing private
sector investment in social capital, public sector investment can be
deduced from national and regional accounts and used as an indicator
of investment of this nature [40][,][42] . Broadly, social capital infrastructure
investment would include expenditure and provision of infrastructure
which includes community facilities, services and networks as well
as the social dimension underpinning the production of goods and
services, prime amongst which are arrangements concerned with
informal on-the-job development and associated support structures.
Box 2 summarizes the key data items concerning social capital
infrastructure investment currently not captured in metrics associated with the systems of national accounts. They are arranged under
three broad categories. The first augments the established categories
concerned with land, dwellings and non-dwelling construction. The
second augments the established categories of intellectual property.
The third set of activities concern an entirely new category of fixed
capital formation, which we term ‘civic capital formation’. The importance of these data items has been identified in the growing literature
concerned with environmental sustainability [36][,][39][,][43], the development
of human capability [44] and social capital [41] .


**Valuation**

A non-market valuation method will be applied to estimate the monetary value of social contributions and social capital infrastructure in a
systematic way. Three distinct approaches to estimating the monetary
value of social contributions are often considered: the replacement
cost, opportunity cost and social benefit approach [35] . The replacement
cost approach seeks to use either an ‘observed market proxy’, which
would involve pricing time spent on a particular social contribution
as the rate of a wage of a paid worker doing roughly the same job [35] .
The opportunity cost approach seeks to determine the value of time
an individual could spend at their regular job if they were not volunteering. However, this would be problematic for those making social



contributions that are not participating in the labour market. Of greater
concern for either the replacement cost or opportunity cost approach
if applied to calculate Mental Wealth, is that they would exacerbate
existing distortions in the market economy. For example, foundational
economy workers (workers in health, care, education, housing, utilities,
food supply and so on) are currently paid poorly despite contributing
significantly to the positive drivers of Mental Wealth. The social benefit approach seeks to estimate the value of the output of the social
contribution. This approach requires either a market proxy for the
output, or where this is indeterminate, it would require a willingnessto-pay assessment that seeks to value the social contribution based
on what the provided service is worth to the receiver [35] . This approach
lacks feasibility for macro applications such as estimation of national
or regional-level Mental Wealth as it has enormous data collection
and management demands. Detailed information would be required
on outputs associated with each act of social contribution (some of
which would be difficult to measure) and determinations would need
to be made regarding the proportion of each output attributable to
the unpaid contribution where contributions are made by volunteers
working alongside paid staff [35] . In addition, applications of this method
across different populations would require an assumption that individuals have the same marginal value of money.
An alternative, more tractable way of capturing the value of nonmarket-mediated social consumption is therefore needed. This will
be achieved by drawing data from those providing the services. This
is easier and likely more accurate than obtaining information directly
from households on their consumption levels (for example, a child
receiving the benefits of volunteer teaching/tutoring at school may
go unreported in a household survey). This approach to estimating
consumption activity is similar to the convention followed in valuing
public sector contributions to consumption where such services are
not mediated through the market. We therefore propose to value the
social contributions of individuals using an input-based approach,
applying a universal value to every hour spent making those contributions that aligns with the median hourly earnings in a given country in
a given year (which equates the value of market and non-market work).
The strength of this approach lies in its feasibility, requiring very few
parameters to calculate, that is, the number of individuals making
social contributions, the number of hours devoted to each activity
category (in addition to demographic data), and the median hourly
earnings. With the exception of regular surveys on volunteering conducted in Australia, Canada, the US, the UK, Switzerland and Norway,
people’s social contributions are not routinely measured as part of
official statistics in most countries. Uptake of the estimation of Mental
Wealth across high- and low-to-middle-income countries requires the
simplicity of a universal input valuation approach. Therefore, a regular, digitally deployed, simplified time use survey with representative
national samples is proposed to supplement the data infrastructure
established alongside the systems of national accounts or other official
routine data collection. Many countries conduct regular labour force
surveys. These provide a platform for expanded capturing of the key
data needed to measure the social contributions of people. To avoid
social desirability bias and overreporting common with surveys on
volunteering, time use surveys use a rigorous methodology to reconcile
reported activities within a 24-hour timeframe [33][,][35] .


**Conclusions**

For too long, researchers in health, business, economics and other
social sciences have worked in relative isolation in understanding
what determines improvements in national prosperity and human
development. Important advances in the literature on the social
determinants of health have gone a long way to building bridges
between different analytical traditions. The challenge is now to go
deeper into integrating insights from different disciplines. At the end
of the Second World War GDP emerged as the pre-eminent measure

### **Box 2**

## Categories that contribute to estimating the investments in social capital infrastructure that enable social production



**Augmentation of established forms of capital formation (land,**
**dwellings and non-dwelling construction)**
_Component 1: Facilities and spaces_
This component includes the physical places for people to meet and
mobilise in their community. This may include sports clubs and fields,
leisure and recreational facilities, community centres, libraries, green
spaces (community gardens), art centres, and community-owned
spaces. The value of the contribution here would be imputed rent that
public authorities (especially local councils) forgo by not charging
the public for access to these spaces.


_Component 2: Building community infrastructure_
This category includes unpaid time spent developing physical and
technical facilities for a community. This includes development
of digital networks and services (websites and web applications),
building community facilities (community hall and recreation areas)
and building protective infrastructure (flood defences).


_Component 3: Unpaid ecological restoration and rewilding_
This category includes unpaid time spent participating in land and
sea management; restoration of biodiversity, ecosystems (farmlands,
forests, marine, urban areas and so on) and animal habitats;
environmental clean-up; and recycling.


**Intellectual-property-related investments**
_Component 4: Unpaid, informal on the job training, development_
_and mentoring_
It has long been recognized that much human development
occurs informally, often on the job. This is formally recognized in
arrangements associated with the skilled trades and recognised
professions. It is, however, also a feature of nearly every form of
work, whether paid or unpaid. Amongst employers, experienced
workers are often preferred to those freshly out of educational
institutions because they have been accultured in the complexity
of work, capabilities that can often only be ‘learnt by doing’, usually
under the tacit supervision of a more experienced colleague. While
vitally important for economic success this form of tacit intellectual
property growth and transfer is not captured in current national
accounting frameworks. This category therefore includes time spent
providing informal professional mentoring, guidance, capacity
building/training workshops to co-workers where these activities are
not the primary responsibilities of the salaried position.


**Civic capital formation**
Components 1–4 augment established forms of capital formation.
An interest in Mental Wealth, however, requires that recognition be


of economic performance and indicator of national prosperity. The
nature of what counts as ‘GDP’ has not, however, been static. To date
its evolution has been primarily shaped by those concerned with
core realms of commerce: most recently agriculture and holders
of intellectual property. As we explore how to ensure GDP’s greater
relevance in our times, it is vital that health and social researchers,
especially those engaged in mental health, neurosciences, and education and training, play an active role. This is particularly important
given the fundamental role of brain capital in driving economic and



given to forms of capital formation currently totally
overlooked in the national accounts. The following categories
draw especially on insights from the rich literature on social
capital. This literature has identified a wide range of matters
“that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit” [49] .
Considerable work has explored the determinants and impact
of factors such as trust for social and economic flourishing.
This is of less interest than the other major strand of this
literature: that which has considered the infrastructures that
enable and support effective social and cultural activity. When
considering how to augment established categories of investment,
this is best described as a concern with ‘infrastructures for
effective collective voice’ and ‘underpinning organisational
infrastructures’ that support coordination and cooperation for
particular communities.


_Component 5: Infrastructure of collective association, including_
_networks, participation in community groups and organised civic_

_engagement_
This component relates to local organizations and services
that assemble groups of people for specific purposes such as
neighbourhood associations, cultural and religious organisations,
voluntary groups, and environmental groups. It includes unpaid
time spent establishing networks and infrastructure that contribute
to civic vibrancy (for example, community associations, forums
for the maintenance and development of traditional knowledge,
language, and practices, a matter of particular importance to
Indigenous communities), organising community activities
(for example, festivals, sporting activities and teams, clubs and
gatherings), and coordinating community responses (for example,
petitioning for rights to participation or the preservation of
ecosystems and natural resources, establishing a neighbourhood
clean-up committee and response to natural disasters). This
category also includes unpaid time spent organizing activities
to promote social and environmental justice, human rights and
cultural identity, and participatory governance, establishing and
running co-operatives, performing unpaid activities for a union,
working on a voter registration drive, and unpaid involvement
in advocacy and lobbying activities.


_Component 6: Infrastructural services to support associational activity_
This component includes services provided to enable individuals and
groups to engage in and conduct voluntary work. This may include
community support services such as language support services,
community skills training services, library resources and local
transport services.


                                                  social production, the recognition of social context as shaping men
tal capital, mental health and collective well-being, and the historic
neglect of mental health as evidenced by inadequate investments in
and accountability of mental health systems [45][–][48] . If reporting of the
Mental Wealth of nations occurred as regularly and prominently as
GDP, the possibilities for expanding the realm of debate about the
future of national prosperity and human development are enormous.
This paper has offered very specific, practical suggestions on how we
can work to create those possibilities.
