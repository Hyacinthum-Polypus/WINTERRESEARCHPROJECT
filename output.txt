There is a growing global movement among economic, public policy 
and academic communities questioning the appropriateness of gross 
domestic product (GDP), and specifically its growth, as an indicator of 
progress. Despite the broad range of indices and dashboards that have 
been developed to challenge it, GDP remains entrenched as the essential 
indicator of national prosperity, despite its purpose being to measure 
the size and performance of the economy. The strength of GDP lies in 
its established centrality in policymaking as well as its rhetorical and 
conceptual simplicity; it is in essence the value of monetized tangible 
goods and services produced in a given period. Unlike well-being 
indicator dashboards, GDP provides a single measure against which 
governments, the media and the general community can track and 
compare national economic performance. And, while many composite 
indices offer monotonously stable findings, the weekly, quarterly and 
annual fluctuations of GDP prompt policymakers to act (that is, to 
assess reforms, identify constraints and shift policy levers to enhance its 
growth). By contrast, the Mental Wealth metric offers a new approach. 
Rather than joining the chorus of moving beyond GDP, the Mental 
Wealth Initiative first recognises the system of national accounts that 
underpins GDP as a significant human achievement. The initiative then 
seeks to refine, augment and improve GDP as a measure of social welfare 
by broadening the boundary of production to include the value of goods 
and services provided by populations that are not currently monetized 
but make genuine contributions to social prosperity and quality of life. 
Hence, the Mental Wealth metric provides a holistic measure of national 
prosperity, capturing the value of both economic and social production, 
and recognizing the fundamental importance of brain capital (mental 
capital, mental health and brain health) and collective cognitive and 
emotional health and well-being. This paper provides a simple, practical 
strategy for augmenting GDP by monetizing social production, thereby 
establishing a more accurate indicator of the wealth of nations.

production of the traditional economy to include the value created by 
non-market activity that contributes to strengthening the social and 
cultural fabric of communities and social support in work settings. 
Further, the Mental Wealth metric recognises ‘brain capital’ (a nation’s 
collective mental assets: mental capital, mental health and well-being, 
and brain health) as the foundation of economic and social productivity 
(Fig. 1). Specifically, Mental Wealth is the monetary value of the market 
and non-market goods and services produced by the population over 
a given period, and is calculated as follows:
Mental Wealth = μGDPr + Cs + Is
where GDPr is real GDP (for a given period) calculated using the 
expenditure approach, μ is the devaluation coefficient (the downward 
adjustment to GDPr to account for the proportion of expenditure not 
underpinned by mental capital; for example, the value of mineral 
exports net of human input). Cs is the consumption of non-monetized, 
socially provided services; Is represents social capital infrastructure 
investment, namely, the sum of government (and non-government) 
investment in social capital infrastructure (in a given period), not already 
captured in GDP25. Detailed discussion of the origins of Mental Wealth, 
its formulation, comparisons with alternative indicators of national 
prosperity, the importance of systems thinking and an outline of the 
research programme in systems modelling of Mental Wealth is provided 
elsewhere25. This paper seeks to outline more specifically the key con-
structs of Cs (social consumption) and Is (social capital infrastructure 
investment) and define a non-market valuation method to be applied.
Social consumption
Social consumption involves the use of socially provided services 
outside the market. For tractability, the value of social production 
will be used as a proxy for social consumption and its estimation will 
depend on the measurement of time spent undertaking activities 
that provide a social contribution. Social contribution will be viewed 
Humans are ‘ultra-social’ beings1. The nature and quality of our social ties 
are central to our health and well-being, which underpin individual-level 
capability and resilience2,3. At a societal level, how social systems are 
structured and the strength and operation of social networks are funda-
mental to community cohesion and social stability2. Social networks can 
profoundly shape people’s access to both resources and opportunities. 
Participation in socially productive activities has been shown to improve 
quality of life4; physical, cognitive, and mental health5–9; and labour 
market outcomes through skills training and access to the labour force10. 
Social mobilization around ecosystem maintenance and restoration 
(for example, rewilding) has the potential to contribute significantly 
to economic prosperity given that at least half of the world’s GDP is 
dependent on nature11,12, and given that the global ecological footprint 
has exceeded global biocapacity13. Despite these individual, societal, 
environmental and economic benefits, unpaid socially productive activi-
ties are not currently valued within the existing economic framework, 
leaving their contributions to national prosperity unrecognized. In addi-
tion, GDP contains a number of ‘regrettables’—activities that increase 
economic activity but do not contribute to quality of life such as war, 
higher transport costs due to traffic congestion, pollution abatement 
and reconstruction following natural disasters14.
The exclusion of (unpaid) informal and socially productive activi-
ties from estimates of national prosperity has significant implications. 
First, social and economic development is fundamentally shaped by 
what is measured15,16. Measurement makes the invisible visible, giving 
credence to the value of social production. Measurement helps to 
assess progress, stimulate public debate, aid advocacy efforts, pro-
mote community mobilization, and inform policy and investment 
priorities. Historically, the system of national accounts (giving rise to 
GDP as the key measure of economic performance) were created dur-
ing successive profound crises (the Great Depression and the Second 
World War) not only to measure the size, growth and composition of 
national economies, but also to inform war-time production and post-
war reconstruction efforts17,18. The mechanisms of national accounting 
are said to have evolved to serve underlying political purposes, which 
leads to the question: ‘What would they measure if other purposes were 
dominant?’18. As we look to current widespread efforts to shift soci-
etal trajectories (such as the movements to achieve greater equality, 
arrest climate change and catalyse post-pandemic reconstruction 
for enhanced well-being and community and system resilience19), our 
efforts are likely to be impeded by the continued exclusion of socially 
productive activities from the dominant economic metric: GDP.
Second, the exclusion of extra-market activities sends a signal that 
society does not value the contributions made by those not in the formal 
labour market. When employment is privileged as a legitimate social role 
and indicator of societal integration, structural and social marginaliza-
tion of the unemployed, older adults and the disabled lead to stigma, 
inequality, lower social participation, intergenerational dependence 
and care, and the erosion of mental health and well-being20–22. Placing 
greater emphasis on the value of non-market activities undertaken in 
and for communities may guard against these negative effects23.
Third, neglecting measurement of and investment in social pro-
duction fails to recognise the extent to which it enhances economic 
productivity (access to additional networks, resources, opportunities, 
informal skills training and mentorship, and intergenerational knowl-
edge transmission) and reduces demands on governments (through 
the networks and norms of reciprocity it fosters)24.
We propose a new ‘Mental Wealth’ metric that seeks to quantify 
the value of economic and social production to ensure a more com-
plete picture of national (and regional) prosperity25. Mental Wealth is 
defined as “a measure of national prosperity that captures the value 
generated by the deployment of collective mental assets and support-
ing social infrastructure and focuses on the contributions made by all 
human beings to material and especially non-material standards of 
living”25. The metric makes an explicit attempt to shift the boundary of

Fig. 1 | Defining Mental Wealth. Mental Wealth is a holistic measure of national 
prosperity that monetizes the value generated by a nation’s economic and social 
productivity. Mental Wealth is underpinned by a nation’s collective mental 
assets (brain capital) and influenced by a range of health, social, economic, and 
environmental factors.

through the framework of a sociological model of social productiv-
ity based on the notion of exchange reciprocity. This involves the 
provision of a social service valued by the recipient(s) for which 
no contract or financial remuneration is exchanged (other than 
potential reimbursement of expenses)26. Expressions of reciprocity 
to fulfil unmet individual and community needs create new bonds 
of solidarity between disparate groups of people, businesses and 
public institutions through the acts of “giving, receiving and giv-
ing in return”27,28. While social productivity contributes value to the 
measure of national prosperity (Mental Wealth), it also acts in part 
to redistribute resources between the economic and social arenas, 
acting as a temporary stabilizer to disruptive events. For example, 
the services arising from mobilization of volunteers and charitable 
community organizations in response to natural disasters can help 
communities rebuild more quickly. Similarly, during the COVID-19 
pandemic, social mobilization around public health orders sought 
to arrest transmission and reduce the overall economic impact29,30. 
Social production has the potential to reduce the need for government 
services and can extend beyond government reach (for example, to 
remote or marginalized communities). It does not, however, replace 
the need for government provision of social services. Indeed, evidence 
suggests that a country’s social spending (as a proportion of GDP) 
and civic culture (for example, higher degrees of civil liberties) are 
positively correlated with volunteerism, helping and caring31. An 
important dimension of prosperity is caring economics comprising 
affiliative and compassionate personal relationships, a sense of social 
belonging, cooperative contributions to the workplace and society, 
and creating trustworthiness and trust32.
Because the production and consumption of social contributions 
are not mediated by monetary valuation in markets, and given they 
are likely to be differentially valued by receivers, monetary value will 
be calculated based on the value of time spent delivering the social 
contribution (input valuation). Activities that are socially valued by 
any given community, region or nation are likely to differ by cultural, 
historical, social, economic and political context. However, the key 
activity categories outlined in Box 1 aim to capture social contribu-
tions that have universal relevance for estimation of Mental Wealth. 
The activity categories outlined should not be considered exhaus-
tive as they are likely to evolve and expand over time to account for 
cultural and technological shifts. They merely offer a starting point 
from which to elaborate, as per the historic evolution of the systems 
of national accounts. The listing draws on long-established literature 
concerning studies of time use33, feminist economics34, the nature of 
volunteering35 and principles that underpin the strengths of Indigenous 
cultures36–39. Finally, it is intentional that the activity categories are 
not weighted—time spent undertaking any of the outlined socially 
productive activities (which will differ by age, sex, cultural background 
and socioeconomic status) is considered to be of equal importance.
Social capital infrastructure investment
In devising a more appropriate metric for national prosperity, the other 
element of gross national expenditure that needs to be augmented 
Box 1
Activity categories that contribute to estimating the social 
contribution of individuals to the Mental Wealth of nations
Category 1: Volunteering and unpaid charity work
This category includes unpaid time spent participating  
in emergency services (for example, lifesaving and  
firefighting); volunteering at community festivals and  
cultural events; fundraising undertaken in aid of a charity; 
community gardening; participation in healthcare delivery  
and free clinics; working in a soup kitchen; distributing  
food, medical or material goods; providing legal advice; 
providing counselling support; and making clothes for 
disadvantaged populations.
Category 2: Unpaid education and care of children
This category includes unpaid time spent providing education,  
active supervision and domestic care for a child or children aged 
under 18 years including own children and children of friends, 
neighbours and extended family. This also includes time spent 
undertaking unpaid teaching at a school; providing tutoring or 
homework assistance; passing on cultural knowledge, customs 
and traditions (a matter of special importance to Indigenous 
communities); and unpaid babysitting.
Category 3: Unpaid care of older people and people with illnesses 
or disabilities
This category includes time spent undertaking unpaid  
domestic support for older people and people with illnesses  
or disabilities. Examples include assisting with self-care  
activities, buying groceries for a neighbour, driving them to 
appointments, assisting participation in cultural activities and 
cleaning their home.
Category 4: Crowd service
This category includes time spent providing a ‘crowd service’ where 
no direct or indirect (for example, advertising) income is received. 
Consumers provide information, instructions, tools, advice and so on 
to each other as an unpaid service (for example, Wikipedia, YouTube 
videos, open-source software and blogs).
Category 5: Unpaid contributions to the creative arts
This category includes unpaid time spent performing and creating 
works of art, music, dance, storytelling and drama.
Excluded activities
Excluded activities include individual hobbies; leisure time; 
vacations; vlogging, reviewing and marketing of products; criminal 
activities; volunteering during paid time off by an employer; and 
non-childcare-related domestic activities in own home. Although 
potentially controversial, under the current conceptual framework 
of Mental Wealth, domestic duties in one’s own home are not 
considered to contribute to social production, social connectedness, 
and strengthening the social fabric of communities and nations. 
Counting unpaid domestic activities within one’s own home would 
detract from an emphasis on encouraging social and economic 
participation outside the home, it would also introduce a source of 
potential stability in the metric that would fail to detect changes in 
social prosperity. For example, large proportions of the population 
shifting from community-building volunteering activities to domestic 
activities inside their own homes would significantly affect social 
prosperity but would not be detected as a change in the Mental 
Wealth metric (that is, if unpaid domestic work was included in Cs).

concerns investment. Traditionally, the composition of gross fixed 
capital formation has concerned dwelling and non-dwelling construc-
tion along with investment in machinery and equipment. As national 
accounts have evolved, new categories of investment have been rec-
ognised. The most recent additions have been cultivated biological 
resources and intellectual property products. Within the Mental Wealth 
framework, social capital infrastructure investment now seeks to 
include the sum of government, community and private sector invest-
ments in the opportunity structures that enable social production 
and social connectedness; namely, investments in facilities, spaces, 
services and networks that are not already captured in GDP. Physical 
and institutional social infrastructure are key to the propagation and 
continuity of social connections, stability, the preservation of cultural 
identity and maintenance of socio-cultural diversity of Indigenous and 
local communities, and the vibrancy of civic life40. Investments directed 
towards enhancing social and cultural centres can contribute to enrich-
ing connections within and across communities, thereby growing the 
potential for individuals to be engaged in socially productive activities.
Provision of this infrastructure can be seen as an important factor 
for creating opportunities for social and cultural participation and 
developing the functional capabilities of a community as well as work-
places. The literature on the impact and value of such an investment has 
not been sufficiently substantiated yet, given the complexity in deter-
mining the sources of social capital investment, its relation to social 
capital formation, and the consequent socially productive activities41. 
Additionally, data sources concerning social infrastructure spending 
currently exist disparately at the workplace, community and regional 
levels, adding to the complexity of obtaining a clear indication of the 
scale and direction of investments. To capture the value that social capi-
tal infrastructure investments contribute to national prosperity, a more 
precise measurement of this expenditure is needed. This would involve 
consolidating information on social infrastructure and amenities use 
and their resourcing. Although there is difficulty in capturing private 
sector investment in social capital, public sector investment can be 
deduced from national and regional accounts and used as an indicator 
of investment of this nature40,42. Broadly, social capital infrastructure 
investment would include expenditure and provision of infrastructure 
which includes community facilities, services and networks as well 
as the social dimension underpinning the production of goods and 
services, prime amongst which are arrangements concerned with 
informal on-the-job development and associated support structures.
Box 2 summarizes the key data items concerning social capital 
infrastructure investment currently not captured in metrics associ-
ated with the systems of national accounts. They are arranged under 
three broad categories. The first augments the established categories 
concerned with land, dwellings and non-dwelling construction. The 
second augments the established categories of intellectual property. 
The third set of activities concern an entirely new category of fixed 
capital formation, which we term ‘civic capital formation’. The impor-
tance of these data items has been identified in the growing literature 
concerned with environmental sustainability36,39,43, the development 
of human capability44 and social capital41.
Valuation
A non-market valuation method will be applied to estimate the mon-
etary value of social contributions and social capital infrastructure in a 
systematic way. Three distinct approaches to estimating the monetary 
value of social contributions are often considered: the replacement 
cost, opportunity cost and social benefit approach35. The replacement 
cost approach seeks to use either an ‘observed market proxy’, which 
would involve pricing time spent on a particular social contribution 
as the rate of a wage of a paid worker doing roughly the same job35. 
The opportunity cost approach seeks to determine the value of time 
an individual could spend at their regular job if they were not volun-
teering. However, this would be problematic for those making social 
contributions that are not participating in the labour market. Of greater 
concern for either the replacement cost or opportunity cost approach 
if applied to calculate Mental Wealth, is that they would exacerbate 
existing distortions in the market economy. For example, foundational 
economy workers (workers in health, care, education, housing, utilities, 
food supply and so on) are currently paid poorly despite contributing 
significantly to the positive drivers of Mental Wealth. The social ben-
efit approach seeks to estimate the value of the output of the social 
contribution. This approach requires either a market proxy for the 
output, or where this is indeterminate, it would require a willingness-
to-pay assessment that seeks to value the social contribution based 
on what the provided service is worth to the receiver35. This approach 
lacks feasibility for macro applications such as estimation of national 
or regional-level Mental Wealth as it has enormous data collection 
and management demands. Detailed information would be required 
on outputs associated with each act of social contribution (some of 
which would be difficult to measure) and determinations would need 
to be made regarding the proportion of each output attributable to 
the unpaid contribution where contributions are made by volunteers 
working alongside paid staff35. In addition, applications of this method 
across different populations would require an assumption that indi-
viduals have the same marginal value of money.
An alternative, more tractable way of capturing the value of non-
market-mediated social consumption is therefore needed. This will 
be achieved by drawing data from those providing the services. This 
is easier and likely more accurate than obtaining information directly 
from households on their consumption levels (for example, a child 
receiving the benefits of volunteer teaching/tutoring at school may 
go unreported in a household survey). This approach to estimating 
consumption activity is similar to the convention followed in valuing 
public sector contributions to consumption where such services are 
not mediated through the market. We therefore propose to value the 
social contributions of individuals using an input-based approach, 
applying a universal value to every hour spent making those contribu-
tions that aligns with the median hourly earnings in a given country in 
a given year (which equates the value of market and non-market work). 
The strength of this approach lies in its feasibility, requiring very few 
parameters to calculate, that is, the number of individuals making 
social contributions, the number of hours devoted to each activity 
category (in addition to demographic data), and the median hourly 
earnings. With the exception of regular surveys on volunteering con-
ducted in Australia, Canada, the US, the UK, Switzerland and Norway, 
people’s social contributions are not routinely measured as part of 
official statistics in most countries. Uptake of the estimation of Mental 
Wealth across high- and low-to-middle-income countries requires the 
simplicity of a universal input valuation approach. Therefore, a regu-
lar, digitally deployed, simplified time use survey with representative 
national samples is proposed to supplement the data infrastructure 
established alongside the systems of national accounts or other official 
routine data collection. Many countries conduct regular labour force 
surveys. These provide a platform for expanded capturing of the key 
data needed to measure the social contributions of people. To avoid 
social desirability bias and overreporting common with surveys on 
volunteering, time use surveys use a rigorous methodology to reconcile 
reported activities within a 24-hour timeframe33,35.
Conclusions
For too long, researchers in health, business, economics and other 
social sciences have worked in relative isolation in understanding 
what determines improvements in national prosperity and human 
development. Important advances in the literature on the social 
determinants of health have gone a long way to building bridges 
between different analytical traditions. The challenge is now to go 
deeper into integrating insights from different disciplines. At the end 
of the Second World War GDP emerged as the pre-eminent measure

of economic performance and indicator of national prosperity. The 
nature of what counts as ‘GDP’ has not, however, been static. To date 
its evolution has been primarily shaped by those concerned with 
core realms of commerce: most recently agriculture and holders 
of intellectual property. As we explore how to ensure GDP’s greater 
relevance in our times, it is vital that health and social researchers, 
especially those engaged in mental health, neurosciences, and educa-
tion and training, play an active role. This is particularly important 
given the fundamental role of brain capital in driving economic and 
social production, the recognition of social context as shaping men-
tal capital, mental health and collective well-being, and the historic 
neglect of mental health as evidenced by inadequate investments in 
and accountability of mental health systems45–48. If reporting of the 
Mental Wealth of nations occurred as regularly and prominently as 
GDP, the possibilities for expanding the realm of debate about the 
future of national prosperity and human development are enormous. 
This paper has offered very specific, practical suggestions on how we 
can work to create those possibilities.
Box 2
Categories that contribute to estimating the investments in social 
capital infrastructure that enable social production
Augmentation of established forms of capital formation (land, 
dwellings and non-dwelling construction)
Component 1: Facilities and spaces
This component includes the physical places for people to meet and 
mobilise in their community. This may include sports clubs and fields, 
leisure and recreational facilities, community centres, libraries, green 
spaces (community gardens), art centres, and community-owned 
spaces. The value of the contribution here would be imputed rent that 
public authorities (especially local councils) forgo by not charging 
the public for access to these spaces.
Component 2: Building community infrastructure
This category includes unpaid time spent developing physical and 
technical facilities for a community. This includes development 
of digital networks and services (websites and web applications), 
building community facilities (community hall and recreation areas) 
and building protective infrastructure (flood defences).
Component 3: Unpaid ecological restoration and rewilding
This category includes unpaid time spent participating in land and 
sea management; restoration of biodiversity, ecosystems (farmlands, 
forests, marine, urban areas and so on) and animal habitats; 
environmental clean-up; and recycling.
Intellectual-property-related investments
Component 4: Unpaid, informal on the job training, development  
and mentoring
It has long been recognized that much human development 
occurs informally, often on the job. This is formally recognized in 
arrangements associated with the skilled trades and recognised 
professions. It is, however, also a feature of nearly every form of 
work, whether paid or unpaid. Amongst employers, experienced 
workers are often preferred to those freshly out of educational 
institutions because they have been accultured in the complexity 
of work, capabilities that can often only be ‘learnt by doing’, usually 
under the tacit supervision of a more experienced colleague. While 
vitally important for economic success this form of tacit intellectual 
property growth and transfer is not captured in current national 
accounting frameworks. This category therefore includes time spent 
providing informal professional mentoring, guidance, capacity 
building/training workshops to co-workers where these activities are 
not the primary responsibilities of the salaried position.
Civic capital formation
Components 1–4 augment established forms of capital formation. 
An interest in Mental Wealth, however, requires that recognition be 
given to forms of capital formation currently totally  
overlooked in the national accounts. The following categories 
draw especially on insights from the rich literature on social 
capital. This literature has identified a wide range of matters  
“that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit”49. 
Considerable work has explored the determinants and impact  
of factors such as trust for social and economic flourishing.  
This is of less interest than the other major strand of this  
literature: that which has considered the infrastructures that 
enable and support effective social and cultural activity. When 
considering how to augment established categories of investment, 
this is best described as a concern with ‘infrastructures for 
effective collective voice’ and ‘underpinning organisational 
infrastructures’ that support coordination and cooperation for 
particular communities.
Component 5: Infrastructure of collective association, including 
networks, participation in community groups and organised civic 
engagement
This component relates to local organizations and services 
that assemble groups of people for specific purposes such as 
neighbourhood associations, cultural and religious organisations, 
voluntary groups, and environmental groups. It includes unpaid 
time spent establishing networks and infrastructure that contribute 
to civic vibrancy (for example, community associations, forums 
for the maintenance and development of traditional knowledge, 
language, and practices, a matter of particular importance to 
Indigenous communities), organising community activities  
(for example, festivals, sporting activities and teams, clubs and 
gatherings), and coordinating community responses (for example, 
petitioning for rights to participation or the preservation of 
ecosystems and natural resources, establishing a neighbourhood 
clean-up committee and response to natural disasters). This 
category also includes unpaid time spent organizing activities 
to promote social and environmental justice, human rights and 
cultural identity, and participatory governance, establishing and 
running co-operatives, performing unpaid activities for a union, 
working on a voter registration drive, and unpaid involvement  
in advocacy and lobbying activities.
Component 6: Infrastructural services to support associational activity
This component includes services provided to enable individuals and 
groups to engage in and conduct voluntary work. This may include 
community support services such as language support services, 
community skills training services, library resources and local 
transport services.
